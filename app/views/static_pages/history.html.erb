      <p>Sherle Wagner founded his company with his wife Rose in 1945 for the purpose of offering extraordinary bathroom fixtures, accessories and hardware. An architect by training, he recognized that the utilitarian does not have to be mundane. Mr. Wagner thus elevated often-overlooked bath elements to an elegance not previously found on the market. First offering an exquisite dolphin faucet with a 24-karat gold finish, Mr. Wagner’s goal was to offer a discerning clientele the opportunity to “complete the ultimate luxury bathroom.” Exquisite craftsmanship and old-world techniques were of utmost importance in presenting his glorious designs.</p>
      <p>
      Mr. Wagner continued his strong appreciation for art and architecture throughout his life. His finely trained and sensitive eye established the foundation for the company’s exquisite esthetic, which is now synonymous with the finest in taste and craftsmanship.
      </p>
      <p>
      Soon Sherle Wagner was able to count Presidents and movie stars among his glamorous clientele. Today, each piece from our broad collection is still meticulously fabricated in small batches using old-world techniques in our facility located here in the United States.</p>
